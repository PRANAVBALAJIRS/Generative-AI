Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these\\nwere completed before the first pitch. :-)\\n\\nAL East\\n1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division\\n2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.\\n3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect\\n4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop\\n5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing\\n6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak\\n7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th\\n\\nAl West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top\\n          4 gets pitching should win it.\\n1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success\\n2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?\\n3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.\\n4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close\\n5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here\\n6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs\\n7.  California Angels - will win no games\\n\\nNL East\\n1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!\\n2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga\\n3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected\\n4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a \\\"team\\\"\\n5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me\\n6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing\\n7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing\\n\\nNL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.\\n1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern\\n2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all\\n3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2\\n4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993\\n5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants\\n6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink\\n7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.\\n\\n\\nNLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting\\n                            what I said in my NL West comment.)\\nALCS  New York d. Minnesota\\n\\nWorld Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be\\n                                     fashionable again\\n\\nNL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff\\nNL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo\\nAL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it\\nAL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))\\n\\n-- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Kenney                                       kenney@tribe.b17d.ingr.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"hockey\",\n          \"baseball\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
